This dataset contains raw data for the Maternal Brain Project, a project that uses precision imaging methods to map the human maternal brain starting pre-conception through postpartum and beyond. Subjects undergo repeated multi-modal MRI, venipuncture, and mood/health assessments over the course of pregnancy. 

Data will be released iteratively. The first installment of data (V1) involves the Maternal Brain Project-Pilot, wherein a single nulliparous woman completed 26 MRI scans (T1w, high-resolution MTL, DWI) alongside state-dependent measures and serum assessments of sex hormones from pre-conception through two years postpartum. Future data releases will involve extended phenotyping in a larger cohort of participants and their partners both in the United States (V2) and Internationally (V3).

V1 notes: 
- Final two sessions (ses-26 & ses-27) took place within a 24-hr period to measure test-retest reliability of MRI measures between the two scanning sites, UCI and UCSB.
- Due to technical difficulties, fmaps for ses-07 have different scan parameters (see json file)
- For more details regarding scan parameters, see json files located in each session's modality folder
